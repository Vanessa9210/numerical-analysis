Numerical Analysis Project created by Vanessa Funes y Joel Ramirez
In this project the following problem codes shown
Problem 1:  Simulation. Complete the estimation for the probability of a neutron to emerge from the lead wall seen in class an explained in section 13.3 of Cheney.

Problem 2:  Implement Brent’s Method. While secant and false position formally converge faster than bisection, one ﬁnds in practice pathological functions for which bisection converges more rapidly. These can be choppy, discontinuous functions, or even smooth functions if the second derivative changes sharply near the root. Bisection always halves the interval, while secant and false position can sometimes spend many cycles slowly pulling distant bounds closer to a root. Ridders’ method does a much better job, but it too can sometimes be fooled. Is there a way to combine superlinear convergence with the sureness of bisection? The answer to this is yes: using Bren’ts method. Read and implement Brent’s method from [Press, et al., p. 354]. Show how your program works. 

Problem 3: [Moler, Numerical Computing with MATLAB, exercise 6.1, modiﬁed]. Implement Adaptive Quadrature using Simpson’s Rule as worked in class. Complete the following table, where the blank spaces correspond to the number of function evaluations needed to obtain the desired precision.

Problem 4: Monte Carlo. What is the expected value of the volume of a tetrahedron formed by four points chosen randomly inside the tetrahedron whose vertices are (0,0,0), (0,1,0),(0,0,1), and (1,0,0)? (The precise answer is unknown!)
